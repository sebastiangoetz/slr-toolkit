	Computing. Our approach leverages utility functions, at the level
	of an autonomic application, or even a single task or feature being
	exercised within that application. This paper describes the fundamental
	steps of our approach: instrumentation of the application; collection
	of exhaustive samples of runtime data about relevant quality attributes
	of the application, as well as characteristics of its runtime environment;
	elicitation of a utility function through statistical correlation
	over the collected data points; and embedding of code corresponding
	to the equation of the elicited utility function within the runtime
	of the application, which enables online evaluation of utility values.
	To illustrate our elicitation method, as well as our framework for
	instrumentation, monitoring, and utility function embedding/evaluation,
	we discuss our experience with two different case studies, with their
	results and implications.},

	the concept of multi-agent Abstract State Machines to specify decentralized
	adaptation control by using MAPE computations. We support techniques

	of the correctness of the adaptation logic as implemented by the
	MAPE-K loops. In particular, a verification technique based on meta-properties
	is proposed to allow discovering unwanted interferences between MAPE-K

  title = {Foundations for Streaming Model Transformations by Complex Event
	Processing},
  journal = {Software {\&} Systems Modeling},
  year = {2016},
  month = {May},
  abstract = {Streaming model transformations represent a novel class of transformations
	to manipulate models whose elements are continuously produced or
	modified in high volume and with rapid rate of change. Executing
	streaming transformations requires efficient techniques to recognize
	activated transformation rules over a live model and a potentially
	infinite stream of events. In this paper, we propose foundations
	of streaming model transformations by innovatively integrating incremental
	model query, complex event processing (CEP) and reactive (event-driven)
	transformation techniques. Complex event processing allows to identify
	relevant patterns and sequences of events over an event stream. Our
	approach enables event streams to include model change events which
	are automatically and continuously populated by incremental model
	queries. Furthermore, a reactive rule engine carries out transformations
	on identified complex event patterns. We provide an integrated domain-specific
	language with precise semantics for capturing complex event patterns
	and streaming transformations together with an execution engine,
	all of which is now part of the Viatra reactive transformation framework.
	We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach with two case studies:
	one in an advanced model engineering workflow; and one in the context
	of on-the-fly gesture recognition.},

	problem. This paper proposes a solution that uses architectural templates,

	at runtime to control the agents' self-organising behaviour and results.
	The solution ensures, by construction, that any resulting software
	system meets a set of predefined goals, or constraints, while maintaining
	many of the self-organisation related advantages. A framework prototype
	was implemented and tested to show the viability of the proposed

	all relevant aspects of the design (functional, concurrency, hardware,
	communication, energy, etc.). The formalism can be used to evaluate
	and suggest architectural patterns for signal processing type of
	applications. Moreover, an architecture design evaluation tool according
	to the modeling formalism is described, which can place the system
	design under various execution scenarios (e.g. node mobility, node
	failure, communication link deterioration, etc.) and determine emerging
	system properties (such as expected lifetime, availability of services,
	throughput, response times, etc.). Distinguishing feature of the
	tool is that it allows for modeling runtime reconfiguration solutions
	(e.g. distributed optimization, constraint solvers) and making changes
	in the underlying system architecture and thus evaluate the effects
	of the reconfiguration. The evaluation tool can be embedded into
	a design optimizer, which allows an optimal trade-off between design-time
	and runtime configuration to be determined. The effectiveness of
	the approach and the tool is demonstrated via two application cases
	(structural integrity monitoring, greenhouse temperature distribution
	estimation).},

	Applications of TAS range from on-line self-optimization of in-production
	applications to automatic generation of QoS/cost driven elastic scaling
	policies, and support for what-if analysis on the scalability of
	transactional applications. The key innovation at the core of TAS
	is a novel performance forecasting methodology that relies on the
	joint usage of analytical modeling and machine-learning. By exploiting
	these two, classically competing, methodologies in a synergic fashion,
	TAS achieves the best of the two worlds, namely high extrapolation
	power and good accuracy even when faced with complex workloads deployed
	over public cloud infrastructures. We demonstrate the accuracy and
	feasibility of TAS via an extensive experimental study based on a
	fully fledged prototype implementation, integrated with a popular
	open-source transactional in-memory data store (Red Hat's Infinispan),

	of operation response times, incorporating architectural information

	Comprising quality of service data, such as response times, resource
	utilization, and anomaly scores, OCL-based monitoring rules specify
	the adaptive monitoring coverage. This enables to zoom into a system's
	or component's internal realization in order to locate root causes
	of software failures and to prevent failures by early fault determination
	and correction. The approach has been implemented as part of the
	Kieker monitoring and analysis framework. The evaluation presented

	adaptation is required because a software's environment changes during
	run-time. Thus, all security requirements cannot be defined beforehand.
	To achieve security adaptation, we have combined a security ontology
	that defines security mechanisms, security objectives, and high level
	security measurements. The run-time security adaptation utilises
	this security ontology to adapt security mechanisms or their parameters
	to fulfil security requirements for each environment and usage situation.
	The novelty of this approach comes from the utilisation of ontologies
	and security measurements, which makes adaptation flexible. We validate
	our security adaptation with a case study in a smart space environment.
	The case study proves that security adaptation is able to work autonomously

  abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a semantic-driven approach to system modeling
	for improving the accuracy of anomaly diagnosis. Our framework composes
	heterogeneous families of models, including generic statistical models,
	and resource-specific models into a belief network, i.e., Bayesian
	network. Given a set of models which sense the behavior of various
	system components, the key idea is to incorporate expert knowledge
	about the system structure and dependencies within this structure,
	as meta-correlations across components and models. Our approach is
	flexible, easily extensible and does not put undue burden on the
	system administrator. Expert beliefs about the system hierarchy,
	relationships and known problems can guide learning, but do not need
	to be fully specified. The system dynamically evolves its beliefs
	about anomalies over time. We evaluate our prototype implementation
	on a dynamic content site running the TPC-W industry-standard e-
	commerce benchmark. We sketch a system structure and train our belief
	network using automatic fault injection. We demonstrate that our
	technique provides accurate problem diagnosis in cases of single
	and multiple faults. We also show that our semantic-driven modeling
	approach effectively finds the component containing the root cause
	of injected anomalies, and avoids false alarms for normal changes
	in environment or workload.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a transparent self-configuring architecture
	for automatic scaling with temperature awareness in the database
	tier of a dynamic content Web server. We use a unified approach to
	achieving the joint objectives of performance, efficient resource
	usage and avoiding temperature hot-spots in a replicated database
	cluster. The key novelty in our approach is a lightweight on-line
	learning method for fast adaptations to bottleneck situations. Our
	approach is based on deriving a lightweight performance model of
	the replicated database cluster on the fly. The system trains its
	own model based on perceived correlations between various system
	and application metrics and the query latency for the application.
	The model adjusts itself dynamically to changes in the application
	workload mix. We use our performance model for query latency pre
	diction and determining the number of database replicas necessary
	to meet the incoming load. We adapt by adding the necessary replicas,
	pro-actively in anticipation of a bottleneck situation and we remove
	them automatically in underload. Finally, the system adjusts its
	query scheduling algorithm dynamically in order to avoid temperature
	hot- spots within the replicated database cluster. We investigate
	our transparent database provisioning mechanism in the database tier
	using the TPC-W industry- standard e-commerce benchmark. We demonstrate
	that our technique provides quality of service in terms of both performance
	and avoiding hot-spot machines under different load scenarios. We
	further show that our method is robust to dynamic changes in the
	workload mix of the application.},

	system. Specifically, we generate UML state diagrams for a set of
	interacting objects, including the extension of existing state diagrams
	to support new behavior. The approach is based on digital evolution,
	a form of evolutionary computation that enables a designer to explore
	an enormous solution space for complex problems. In our application
	of this technology, an evolving population of digital organisms is
	subjected to natural selection, where organisms are rewarded for
	generating state diagrams that support key scenarios and satisfy
	critical properties as specified by the developer. To achieve this
	capability, we extended the Avida digital evolution platform to enable
	state diagram generation, and integrated AviDA with third-party software
	engineering tools, e.g., the Spin model checker, to assess the generated
	state diagrams. To illustrate this approach, we successfully applied
	it to the generation of state diagrams describing the autonomous
	navigation behavior of a humanoid robot.},

	execution of cyber-physical systems to represent their context and
	to reason about their runtime behaviour. However, current modeling
	techniques do not allow to cope at the same time with the large-scale,
	distributed, and constantly changing nature of these systems. In
	this paper, we introduce a distributed models@run.time approach,
	combining ideas from reactive programming, peer-to-peer distribution,
	and large-scale models@run.time. We define distributed models as
	observable streams of chunks that are exchanged between nodes in
	a peer-to-peer manner. A lazy loading strategy allows to transparently
	access the complete virtual model from every node, although chunks
	are actually distributed across nodes. Observers and automatic reloading
	of chunks enable a reactive programming style. We integrated our
	approach into the Kevoree Modeling Framework and demonstrate that
	it enables frequently changing, reactive distributed models that
	can scale to millions of elements and several thousand nodes.},

  title = {Transactional execution of hierarchical reconfigurations in cyber-physical
	systems},
  journal = {Software {\&} Systems Modeling},
  year = {2017},
  month = {Feb},
  abstract = {Cyber-physical systems reconfigure the structure of their software
	architecture, e.g., to avoid hazardous situations and to optimize
	operational conditions like their energy consumption. These reconfigurations
	have to be safe so that the systems protect their users or environment
	against harmful conditions or events while changing their structure.
	As software architectures are typically built on components, reconfiguration
	actions need to take into account the component structure. This structure
	should support vertical composition to enable hierarchically encapsulated
	components. While many reconfiguration approaches for cyber-physical
	and embedded real-time systems allow the use of hierarchically embedded
	components, i.e., vertical composition, none of them offers a modeling
	and verification solution to take hierarchical composition, i.e.,
	encapsulation, into account thus limiting reuse and compositional
	verification. In this paper, we present an extension to our existing
	modeling language, MechatronicUML, to enable safe hierarchical reconfigurations.
	The three extensions are (a) an adapted variant of the 2-phase-commit
	protocol to initiate reconfigurations that maintain component encapsulation,
	(b) the integration of feedback controllers during reconfiguration,
	and (c) a verification approach based on (timed) model checking for
	instances of our model. We illustrate our approach on a case study
	in the area of smart railway systems by showing two different use
	cases of our approach. We show that using our approach the systems
	can be easily designed to reconfigure safely.},

	fragments to be distributed and connected to form complex applications.
	There may be potentially tens of thousands of interdependent and
	heterogeneous program fragments running across thousands of nodes.
	While the scale and interconnection imply the need for automation
	to manage the program fragments, the need is intensified because
	the applications operate on live streaming data and thus need to
	be highly available. System-S has been designed with components that
	autonomically manage the program fragments, but the system components
	themselves are also susceptible to failures which can jeopardize
	the system and its applications. The work we present addresses the
	self healing nature of these management components in System-S. In
	particular, we show how one key component of System-S, the job management
	orchestrator, can be abruptly terminated and then recover without
	interrupting any of the running program fragments by reconciling
	with other autonomous system components. We also describe techniques
	that we have developed to validate that the system is able to autonomically
	respond to a wide variety of error conditions including the abrupt
	termination and recovery of key system components. Finally, we show
	the performance of the job management orchestrator recovery for a
	variety of workloads.},

	challenge. In order to apply optimizations almost all conventional
	optimization techniques require a runtime system model. However,
	system models and their solution techniques vary in their strengths
	and limitations. For a rigid system, a single system model is acceptable.
	But if the system is constantly changing its structure then a rigid
	model is not able to represent the system properly, resulting in
	an inefficient use of technique in some cases. Therefore, in this
	paper we propose a framework for an optimization engine that adapts
	the optimization technique based on the system state. The adaptation
	involves selection of techniques based on historical statistics and
	current data, and dynamic generation of a model at runtime. This
	runtime model is then used to apply a relevant optimization technique
	to find a desired optimization plan for the system. We have evaluated
	the proposed framework on an electricity distribution system. Our
	results show that the proposed framework is adaptable, fast and able
	to manage numerous situations.},

	these tools keep lacking an explicit model representation of underlying
	resources making it difficult to introspect, verify or reconfigure
	the system in response to external events. In this paper, we outline
	a novel approach that treats system infrastructure as explicit runtime
	models. A key benefit of using such models@run.time representation
	is that it provides a uniform semantic foundation for resources monitoring
	and reconfiguration. Adopting models at runtime allows one to integrate
	different aspects of system management, such as resource monitoring
	and subsequent verification into an unified view which would otherwise
	have to be done manually and require to use different tools. It also
	simplifies the development of various self-adaptation strategies
	without requiring the engineers and researchers to cope with low-level

	This requires continuous monitoring along with online analysis of
	the data captured by the monitoring system. As a result, there is
	a need to move to systems in which both tasks can be performed in

	management. Coining the term 'monalytics' to refer to the combined
	monitoring and analysis systems used for managing large-scale data

	systems, describes software approaches for implementing them, and
	provides experimental evaluations justifying principles and implementation
	approach. Specific technical contributions include consideration
	of scalability across both 'space' and 'time', the ability to dynamically
	deploy and adjust monalytics functionality at multiple levels of
	abstraction in target systems, and the capability to operate across
	the range of application to hypervisor layers present in large-scale

	of their own behavior, down to some level of detail, and that interpret
	those models to produce that behavior (in some applications, the
	interpreter itself is also modeled). Then when the system changes
	the models, it changes its own behavior. We have shown how our Wrappings
	integration infrastructure facilitates the construction, operation,
	and management of these systems, and the appropriate limitation of
	their variability. In this paper, we argue that the internal reflective
	processes are well-suited to representation by different languages,
	and that as more languages are used, each one can be simpler in definition
	and in its relationships to semiotically neighboring ones. Furthermore,
	the seeming proliferation of internal languages can be organized
	to have very little performance impact, since constant mappings can
	be made directly through partial evaluation. In computing terms,
	we are showing the useful separation into granularity and abstraction
	layers of the different kinds of activity descriptions needed in
	the models. We illustrate the methods and approach on CARS (Computational
	Architecture for Reflective Systems), a testbed for studying cooperating

	measures to anticipate future trends. To yield accurate predictions,
	intelligent systems not only rely on single numerical values, but
	also on structured models aggregated from different sensors. Computation
	theory, based on the discretization of observable data into timed
	events, can easily lead to millions of values. Time series and similar
	database structures can efficiently index the mere data, but quickly
	reach computation and storage limits when it comes to structuring
	and processing IoT data. We propose a concept of continuous models
	that can handle high-volatile IoT data by defining a new type of
	meta attribute, which represents the continuous nature of IoT data.
	On top of traditional discrete object-oriented modeling APIs, we
	enable models to represent very large sequences of sensor values
	by using mathematical polynomials. We show on various IoT datasets
	that this significantly improves storage and reasoning efficiency.},

  abstract = {Modern software systems are increasingly complex and are controlling
	critical activities in many different domains. The traditional assumption
	that these systems will work in a controlled context is slightly
	vanishing. Therefore, it emerges the need of methodologies able to
	determine under what conditions desired goals will be achieved and
	behavioural strategies will be preserved despite (often unavoidable)
	adaptations. In this paper we use the cognitive psychology concept
	of schema to identify the set of properties that an adaptable system
	has to maintain when adapting to changed context. The methodology
	we propose, called AC-contract (Adaptable Code-contract), starts
	from high-level requirements and identifies properties that should
	hold locally on single parts of the system. Local properties are
	represented as contracts directly on the programming language. Specifically,
	AC-contract is able to embed logical propositions in the source code
	as annotations; moreover, it enables verification of adaptable code
	by exploiting a preprocessor that executes the annotations. The methodology
	is applied to a mobile application supporting travellers during their
	journey.},

	based approach, by way of which the mobile devices of users can become
	aware of the physical environment surrounding them. Cognitive heuristics
	are the mental models used in cognitive psychology to describe how
	human brains efficiently process the huge amount of information constantly
	coming from the environment around us. As personal mobile devices
	represent proxies in the cyber world of their human users, we investigate
	how the same cognitive heuristics can be used by mobile devices to
	become self-aware of the features of the physical environment around
	their users. Specifically, we assume that physical locations are
	described as a network of tags. We consider a self-organising opportunistic
	network environment, where devices exchange information when meeting
	directly. We propose algorithms based on cognitive heuristics through
	which users' nodes obtain tags either directly when coming in proximity
	of locations, or indirectly through other nodes they meet. We analyse
	the properties of the networks of tags resulting at individual nodes,
	as they emerge from this process, as a function of various cognitive
	parameters. We show that using cognitive heuristics leads, under
	the same resource constraints, to much more effective information
	diffusion with respect to other reference solutions. Interestingly,
	we find critical thresholds for key parameters that discriminate
	between information diffusion and information loss. Finally, we show
	that, despite resource constraints, the structure of the network
	of tags at individual nodes is remarkably close to the ideal that
	would be obtained with infinite resources.},

  abstract = {Self-adaptation is a prominent property for developing complex distributed
	software systems. Notable approaches to deal with self-adaptation
	are the runtime goal model artifacts. Goals are generally invariant
	along the system lifecycle but contain points of variability for
	allowing the system to decide among many alternative behaviors. This
	work investigates how it is possible to provide goal models at run-time
	that do not contain tasks, i.e. the description of how to address

	and adaptivity are key characteristics of next generation distributed
	systems. The reason for that is not least the advent of computing
	trends like Ubiquitous Computing, Ambient Intelligence, and Cyber
	Physical Systems, where systems are usually open for dynamic integration
	and able to react adaptively to changing situations. Despite being
	open and adaptive it is a common requirement for such systems to
	be safe. However, traditional safety assurance techniques, both state-of-the-practice
	and state-of-the-art, are not sufficient in this context. We recently
	developed some initial solution concepts based on conditional safety
	certificates and corresponding runtime analyses. In this paper we
	show how to operationalize these concepts. To this end we present
	in detail how to specify conditional safety certificates, how to
	transform them into suitable runtime models, and how these models
	finally support dynamic safety evaluations.},

	Consequently, transaction monitoring in enterprise environments often
	involves the manual collation of information spread across a variety
	of infrastructure elements and applications, and is a time- consuming
	and labor-intensive task. To facilitate self- governance in enterprise
	environments, we present an online, non-intrusive and platform-agnostic
	solution for transaction monitoring, where the only inputs required
	are (a) system log files in which footprints left by ongoing transaction
	instances are recorded, and (b) a model of the transaction, in terms
	of the valid sequences of steps that a transaction instance may execute
	and the expected footprint patterns at each step. Given these, our
	solution generates a dynamic execution profile of ongoing transaction
	instances that allows their status to be tracked at individual and
	aggregate levels, even when transaction footprints do not necessarily
	carry correlating identifiers as injected through instrumentation.
	We describe our monitoring architecture and algorithms, results from
	an empirical study, ongoing work on run-time transaction model validation
	and directions for future research.},

  abstract = {In order to meet service level agreements (SLAs) and to maintain peak
	performance for database management systems (DBMS), database administrators
	(DBAs) need to implement policies for effective workload scheduling,
	admission control, and resource provisioning. Accurately predicting
	response times of DBMS queries is necessary for a DBA to effectively
	achieve these goals. This task is particularly challenging due to
	the fact that a database workload typically consists of many concurrently
	running queries and an accurate model needs to capture their interactions.
	Additional challenges are introduced when DBMSes are run in dynamic
	cloud computing environments, where workload, data, and physical
	resources can change frequently, on-the-fly. Building an efficient
	and highly accurate online DBMS performance model that is robust
	in the face of changing workloads, data evolution, and physical resource
	allocations is still an unsolved problem. In this work, our goal
	is to build such an online performance model for database appliances
	using an experiment-driven modeling approach. We use a Bayesian approach
	and build novel Gaussian models that take into account the interaction
	among concurrently executing queries and predict response times of
	individual DBMS queries. A key feature of our modeling approach is
	that the models can be updated online in response to new queries
	or data, or changing resource allocations. We experimentally demonstrate
	that our models are accurate and effective -- our best models have
	an average prediction error of 16.3% in the worst case.},

  abstract = {Applications in virtualized data centers are often subject to Service
	Level Objectives (SLOs) regarding their performance (e.g., latency
	or throughput). In order to fulfill these SLOs, it is necessary to
	allocate sufficient resources of different types (CPU, memory, I/O,
	etc.) to an application. However, the relationship between the application
	performance and the resource allocation is complex and depends on
	multiple factors including application architecture, system configuration,
	and workload demands. In this paper, we present a model-based approach
	to ensure that the application performance meets the user-defined
	SLO efficiently by runtime "vertical scaling" (i.e., adding or removing
	resources) of individual virtual machines (VMs) running the application.
	A layered performance model describing the relationship between the
	resource allocation and the observed application performance is automatically
	extracted and updated online using resource demand estimation techniques.
	Such a model is then used in a feedback controller to dynamically
	adapt the number of virtual CPUs of individual VMs. We have implemented
	the controller on top of the VMware vSphere platform and evaluated
	it in a case study using a real-world email and groupware server.
	The experimental results show that our approach allows the managed
	application to achieve SLO satisfaction in spite of workload demand
	variation while avoiding oscillations commonly observed with state-of-the-art
	threshold-based controllers.},

	timely fault detection during the execution of a software application.
	The approach in- volves collecting a variety of runtime measurements
	and building a geometric enclosure, such as a convex hull, which
	represents the normal (i.e., non-failing) operating space of the
	application being monitored. When collected runtime measurements
	are classified as being outside of the enclosure, the application
	is considered to be in an anomalous (i.e., failing) state. This paper
	presents exper- imental results that illustrate the advantages of
	using a computational geometry approach over the distance based approaches
	of Chi-Squared and Mahalanobis distance. Additionally, we present
	results illustrating the advantages of using the convex-hull enclosure
	for fault detection in favor of a simpler enclosure such as a hyperrectangle},

  abstract = {The increasing availability of smartphones, cameras, and wearables
	with instant data sharing capabilities, and the exploitation of social
	networks for information broadcast, heralds a future of real-time
	information overload. With the growing excess of worldwide streaming
	data, such as images, geotags, text annotations, and sensory measurements,
	an increasingly common service will become one of data summarization.
	The objective of such a service will be to obtain a representative
	sampling of large data streams at a configurable granularity, in
	real-time, for subsequent consumption by a range of data-centric
	applications. This paper describes a general-purpose self-summarizing
	storage service, called Social Trove, for social sensing applications.
	The service summarizes data streams from human sources, or sensors
	in their possession, by hierarchically clustering received information
	in accordance with an application-specific distance metric. It then
	serves a sampling of produced clusters at a configurable granularity
	in response to application queries. While Social Trove is a general
	service, we illustrate its functionality and evaluate it in the specific
	context of workloads collected from Twitter. Results show that Social
	Trove supports a high query throughput, while maintaining a low access
	latency to the produced real-time application-specific data summaries.
	As a specific application case-study, we implement a fact-finding
	service on top of Social Trove.},

  abstract = {Architectural monitoring and adaptation allows self-management capabilities
	of autonomic systems to realize more powerful adaptation steps, which
	observe and adjust not only parameters but also the software architecture.
	However, monitoring as well as adaptation of the architecture of
	a running system in addition to the parameters are considerably more
	complex and only rather limited and costly solutions are available
	today. In this paper we propose a model-driven approach to ease the
	development of architectural monitoring and adaptation for autonomic
	systems. Using meta models and model transformation techniques, we
	were able to realize an incremental synchronization between the run-time
	system and models for different self-management activities. The synchronization
	might be triggered when needed and therefore the activities can operate
	concurrently.},

	by tuning the software, balancing the load or through hardware provisioning.
	This paper investigates a feed-forward adaptation scheme in which
	tuning and provisioning decisions are based on a dynamic predictive
	performance model of the system and the software. The model consists
	of a layered queuing network whose parameters are tuned by tracking
	the system with an Extended Kalman Filter. An optimization algorithm
	searches the system configuration space by using the predictive performance
